# Hello!
### This is my youtube video downloader, i made it with an old batch method that uses a YouTube API and allows you to download videos in mp3 or mp4 format and also lets you select the quality of said video or audio!
## Feel free to use this and share it as you please, BUT as i said it is an old api method and therefore can only work depending on ur google chrome install version and setup.
### Although i do highly recommand downloading my downloader (lol) and giving it a shot as if it works it does give you full quality non corrupted mp3/mp4 files for 'free'. and we all love free...

# How to download:

### Ofc first off scroll down and click the download button, which will bring you to google drive (bc the folders too big to upload to github), right click the folder and select download. After that extract the zip to your desktop and deslete the zip. Then read the "ReadBeforeUsingConfig" txt file.

## Enjoy!!
